Welcome to System on Chip (SoC) Design Flows 
at Oklahoma State University
for AMI 0.6um, AMI 0.35um, TSMC 0.25um, TSMC 0.18um brought to you 
by the 
<a href="http://vcag.ecen.okstate.edu" target="_blank">VLSI Computer
Architecture Research Group</a>
group at 
the Oklahoma State University!  <BR> 
<BR>
<p>Release Notes
<ul>
<li>
<B>Libraries and flows in all three technologies, AMI 0.5um, TSMC 0.25um and
 TSMC 0.18um are now availbale for both Cadence and Synopsys flows.</B>
<li>Please note that pads are only available for AMI 0.5um.
<li>
<p>New for Version 2.7
<ul>
<li>Library: Complete Synopsys and Cadence flows
<li>Flow: TSMC 0.18um and TSMC 0.25um flows are now available for Synopsys flow.
<li>Fixed bug in which a design with no pads didn't work in Synopsys flow. 
<li>Added fat wire (minimum spacing for wide wires) rules for all technologies in Synopsys flow
<li>Adjusted power ring sizes for AMI 0.5 in Synopsys flow to improve initial DRC error count and improve routing.
<li>Modified OAI22X1 standard cell to satisfy fat wire rules.
</ul>

All bugs, comments, questions, or any criticisms are highly encouraged.
